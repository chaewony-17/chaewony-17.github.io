career-profile:
  title: Hello, I'm Chaewon :)
  summary: |
    I am a Master’s student in the Department of Architectural Engineering at Seoul National University, advised by Prof. Changbum R. Ahn. <br>
    My research focuses on construction robotics, robot navigation, and machine learning to enhance safety and efficiency in complex construction environments.<br>
    I am particularly interested in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), perception-aware navigation, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to advance intelligent robotic monitoring in construction sites.
