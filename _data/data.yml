career-profile:
  title: Hello, I'm Chaewon :)
  summary: |
    I am a 2nd year of Master’s student in the Department of Architectural Engineering at Seoul National University, advised by Prof. Changbum R.Ahn. 
    As a member of the SNUCEM Lab, my research focuses on construction robotics, robot navigation, and machine learning to enhance safety and efficiency in complex construction environments.
    My current work investigates how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and perception-aware navigation can enable mobile robots to monitor workers effectively on construction sites, even under challenging conditions such as occlusion. 
    As a further step, I am particularly interested in enhancing robots’ decision-making capabilities in complex contexts and environments by incorporating Vision-Language Model (VLM) inference, thereby contributing to more sophisticated and intelligent monitoring operations.

      I earned my B.S. in Architecture and Building Science from Chung-Ang University, graduating at the top of my class (GPA 4.33/4.5). 
      During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on vision-based safety management, wearable sensor–based worker stress monitoring, and autonomous construction systems at the Construction Technology Innovation Laboratory(ConTILab). 
      I also gained hands-on experience in applying machine learning to vision data and extending it to robotic visual mapping, which further developed into expertise with Robot Operating System (ROS), SLAM, and autonomous navigation technologies.
